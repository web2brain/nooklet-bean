# nooklet-bean
A small nooklet displaying the brewing recipe for a coffee bean.

## Usage
1. Copy the files to your `Nooklets` folder on your nook.
1. Change the name of the folder `Bean` to the name of your bean. The folder name will be the name of the nooklet and also the title for the brewing recipe.
1. Adjust the file [bean.js](Beans/bean.js) in the folder of your bean, adjusting the values toyour settings.
1. Enjoy brewing delicious coffee! :coffee:

## Hints
- The css file is located in the root of the nooklets folder so that it can be changed for all beans at once.
- Currently the text is only in German, but that might be changed...
- "Bean" really means a coffee bean :-)
